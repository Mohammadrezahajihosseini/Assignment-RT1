Exercise 3 python script

We start from the solution of the exercise 2
Put the main code after the definition of the functions. The code should make the robot:
	- 1) find and grab the closest silver marker (token)
	- 2) move the marker on the right
	- 3) find and grab the closest golden marker (token)
	- 4) move the marker on the right
	- 5) start again from 1

The method see() of the class Robot returns an object whose attribute info.marker_type may be MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD or MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER,
depending of the type of marker (golden or silver). 
Modify the code of the exercise2 to make the robot:

1- retrieve the distance and the angle of the closest silver marker. If no silver marker is detected, the robot should rotate in order to find a marker.
2- drive the robot towards the marker and grab it
3- move the marker forward and on the right (when done, you can use the method release() of the class Robot in order to release the marker)
4- retrieve the distance and the angle of the closest golden marker. If no golden marker is detected, the robot should rotate in order to find a marker.
5- drive the robot towards the marker and grab it
6- move the marker forward and on the right (when done, you can use the method release() of the class Robot in order to release the marker)
7- start again from 1

	When done, run with:
	$ python run.py exercise3.py
