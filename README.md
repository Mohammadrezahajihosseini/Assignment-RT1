# Assignment-Research Track 2 (statistic analysis)

# Introduction

Statistical analysis between two solutions; _YOUR SOLUTION_ (created by Prof. Recchuto) and _MY SOLUTION_ (created by me). Analysis is based on 15 different mapping modes that basically Roboto has to find the silver tokens and take it. There are 7 silver tokens across the map. The time it takes Robot to make a complete turn is collected in a matrix to compare between two solutions; over time I took into account, colision number, wrong way number and if there were crashes during mission. The purpose of the analysis is to compare two solutions through the data collected above, inside a matrix and making different analyzes such as analyzing in Bar chart, Pie chart, level of accuracy through standard deviation and T student test to verify hypotheses.

# Hypothesis

Assumption considered that _YOUR SOLUTION_ has less time than _MY SOLUTION_, but _MY SOLUTION_ has more accurate time compare to _YOUR SOLUTION_. The following hypotheses can be verified through various analyzes
